            <p>
                I am currently enrolled at Wake Technical Community College studying web development and design, however my interest in these 
                subjects stem from constant attraction to computers ever since I've been a child. I started writing scripts and small one-off 
                programs when I was 14 in high school, since then I've built small apps for various purposes. At my first job outside of high 
                school, I was given the opportunity to build in-house apps with our proprietary JavaScript frameworks and even some .NET frameworks, 
                which boosted me into the world of web development. I hope to graduate soon and find employmnent in the front-end/back-end web development 
                world.
